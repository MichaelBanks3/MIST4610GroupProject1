3. List the patient's visit time, medication name, duration, and pharmacy name for patients who have 2 or more appointments. Group by patientID.

By grouping the results by patient instead of visit time, we can still monitor medication adherence, pharmacy partnerships, and patient follow-up for patients with frequent visits. This information can be used to optimize patient care, ensure medication compliance, and strengthen relationships with pharmacies.
